# Quest "Collection 03: Set"

## Educational exercise from Wild Code School

This is an exercice to introduce the <code>Set</code> interface from the <code>Collection</code> Java framework.

It teaches how to use the <code>HashSet</code>, <code>LinkedHashSet</code> and <code>TreeSet</code> classes.

Instances of heroes from the <code>Hero</code> class are created, the Avengers, and they are stored into a <code>List</code>. 

The purpose is to use those classes in order to:
- find the oldest hero
- sort all the heroes by age (descending)
- sort the heroes by age (ascending) from Spider-Man to Iron Man (subset)
